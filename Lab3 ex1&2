Compiling and packaging

Will we still be able to run \u201chellopenguin\u201d from any directory if we packaged it into \u201c/usr/share\u201d instead of \u201c/usr/bin\u201d?
No, I try to rename the "bin" to "share" and create the package again and when I try to use "hellopenguin" there is "bash: cd: ex1: No such file or directory". To solve this I use "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/share" and it work.

What is your rationale for the previous answer?
I'm not very sure, but I think "/usr/bin" is generally used for PATH sothat the "fpm" tool make it a "FPM tool defaults to using /usr/bin when creating a package and adds /usr/bin to the PATH during installation.
